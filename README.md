# Welcome to running Leptos CSR (client-side rendered) Apps on Spin!

After installing both the Spin framework and Leptos, then clone this repo and run `trunk watch` in one terminal while also running `spin watch` in another terminal -- in development, when making changes in your Leptos app, the only thing you need to do is reload the browser window: Leptos and Spin will take care of the rest!

For building and releasing the app, run `trunk build --release` and `spin deploy` to get your app up and running in the cloud!
